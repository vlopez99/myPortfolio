          <h2>About Me</h2>
              <div>
                <p>My name is Vincent Lopez. I currently live in Columbus Ohio with my fianc√©, Paige, our pet cat, Selena, and our wonderful cockapoo, Eevee.
                We love to travel together, in fact in the five years that we have been together, we have been to Florida a total of four times. 
                The most recent was in Setptember of 2022 when we went to Disney World (my first time).
                I find myself to be more outgoing and always in a good mood. That's probably why it's so easy for me to make friends and make good conversation. 
                In my free time, I really enjoy sports, playing video games, and spending time with family and friends.
                I  also really enjoy trying new things as I am currently enrolled in a coding bootcamp program with The Ohio State University.
                </p>
                <p>With this coding bootcamp, I really intend to gain the knowledge to be able to create well working web programs.
                I don't have a preference in the kind of work I'll be doing, just as long as my work shows the potential of my work and what I am capable of.
                I want to push through the challenges and work my way to a great spot in my work to eventually support a future family while doing something that interests me.
                If I were to pick a dream job to work with though, I had an interest in programing giant screens at sporting events. Being a football fan, that has my main interest.
                As I had said before, I can work in any environment as long as I have my experience.
