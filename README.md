This is an early porfolio of myself for my work in the OSU Coding Bootcamp.
Here, all of my best work will be stored to show off my skills that I will learn as I advance in the class.


The header of the page has a list of different tabs that can be accessed in my portfolio page.

The body of my page describes me and will in the future, show off the work I have done.

The footer of the page has (fake) information on how to contact me rergarding questions on anything.
